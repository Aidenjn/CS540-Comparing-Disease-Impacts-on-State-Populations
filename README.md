# CS540-Comparing-Disease-Impacts-on-State-Populations
The project will look at the differences and similarities in disease effects on different states in the U.S. during different periods of time. Some of the state information that we want to look into include death rates caused by specific diseases, occurrences of specific diseases, environmental factors that may influence diseases, population density, and how all of these factors changed over time.

Folder structure:
* Data - Place all of the raw data here (csv, etc.).
* Init - Place all SQL scripts that are used to create DB tables.
* Load - Place Python code that loads the raw data into the DB.
