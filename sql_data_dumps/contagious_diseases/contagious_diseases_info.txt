Procedure for retrieval:
1. Clicked "Download" button.
2. Decompress the .zip file and then will get 7 .csv files for different contagious diseases

Proceduce for database insertion:
1. Remove the “state_name” column since it column “state” is the abbreviation of columns “state_name”.
2. The initial “week” columns has both year and week information inside, for example: 199701(Year 1997 and week 01). I used Jupyter notebook to split this column.
	df['Year'] = df.week.map(lambda x: x//100) -> create a new column called "Year" from the original "week" columns
	df['Week'] = df.week.map(lambda x: x%100) -> create a new column called "Week" from the original "week" columns

3. Imported CSV into phpMyAdmin with the following selected:
    * Char set: utf-8
    * Partial import: unchecked
    * Enable foreign key checks: checked
    * Format: CSV
    * Columns separated with: ,
    * Columns enclosed with: "
    * Columns escaped with: "
    * Lines terminated with: auto
    * The first line of the file contains the table column names: unchecked
    * Do not abort on INSERT error: unchecked
(Problem: the transformation process crashed if I click "The first line of the file contains the table column names". So I did it without using that function, and the first row of the output I got is column names. I then fixed this problem on mysqlworkbrench manually.)

4. Exported as CSV named "contagious_diseases" with the following selected:
    * Export method: Quick
    * Format: SQL
    * Rows: Dump all rows
5. Modified the dump file in the following ways:
    * Changed all `TABLE 4` entries to `StatesDiabetes`
    * Changed Year column to year(4) type
    * Changed cases column to integer(5) type
    * Changed incidence_per_capita column to float(20) type
    * Changed Week column to integer(4) type
