Query of searching TOP3 and Bottom3:

SELECT M.State, SUM(M.Crude_Rate) FROM MultipleDiseases M
WHERE M.YEAR >=1999 AND M.YEAR <= 2010 
AND (SELECT MAX(M1.Crude_Rate) 
        FROM `MultipleDiseases` M1 
        WHERE M1.State = M.State AND M1.Disease <> "Total")
GROUP BY M.State
ORDER BY SUM(M.Crude_Rate) DESC


Created a view to join ‘MultipleDiseases’ and ‘Health_care_access_coverage’ relations

View for TOP 3:
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW TOP3_Mortality AS
SELECT M.Year, M.State, M.Crude_Rate, M.Population, H.Have_health_care_coverage
FROM MultipleDiseases M
LEFT JOIN Health_care_access_coverage H ON M.YEAR = H.Year AND M.State = H.State
WHERE M.State IN ("West Virginia", "Pennsylvania", "Arkansas")
AND M.Disease = ("Total")
AND M.Year >= 1999 AND M.Year <= 2010
ORDER BY M.YEAR ASC

View for Bottom 3:
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW Bottom3_Mortality AS
SELECT M.Year, M.State, M.Crude_Rate, M.Population, H.Have_health_care_coverage
FROM MultipleDiseases M
LEFT JOIN Health_care_access_coverage H ON M.YEAR = H.Year AND M.State = H.State
WHERE M.State IN ("Colorado", "Utah", "Alaska")
AND M.Disease = ("Total")
AND M.Year >= 1999 AND M.Year <= 2010
ORDER BY M.YEAR ASC
