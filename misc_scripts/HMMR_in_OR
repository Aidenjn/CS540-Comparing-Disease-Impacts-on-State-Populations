We have datasets about Hepatitis, Measles, Mumps and Rubella from 1960s to 1990s. Creating a view to document the years in Oregon that all 4 diseases have case records:

1.
CREATE VIEW YearsHMMR AS 
(SELECT DISTINCT Year FROM hepatitis WHERE hepatitis.state = 'OR'
INTERSECT 
SELECT DISTINCT Year FROM measles WHERE measles.state = 'OR'
INTERSECT 
SELECT DISTINCT Year FROM mumps WHERE mumps.state = 'OR'
INTERSECT 
SELECT DISTINCT Year FROM rubella WHERE rubella.state = 'OR')

2.
Find the sum of Measles cases in Oregon in those years:
SELECT Year, SUM(cases) AS hepatitis
FROM hepatitis WHERE state = 'OR' AND Year = ANY (
    SELECT * FROM YearsHMMR
) GROUP BY Year

Find the sum of Measles cases in Oregon in those years:
SELECT SUM(cases) AS measles
FROM measles WHERE state = 'OR' AND Year = ANY (
    SELECT * FROM YearsHMMR
) GROUP BY Year

SELECT SUM(cases) AS mumps
FROM mumps WHERE state = 'OR' AND Year = ANY (
